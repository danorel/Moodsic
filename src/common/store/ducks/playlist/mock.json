  "description": "Although the Air Jordan VI brought MJ his first of many championships, it also marked the end of Nike branding and visible Air windows on a Jordan silhouette. Taking inspiration from luxury sports cars with the heel tab mimicking a rear spoiler, this latest colorway features a dynamic pattern on the mesh overlays while the rubber outsole provides traction from the classroom to the playground.",
